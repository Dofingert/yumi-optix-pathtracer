# YUMI-Optix-Pathtracer

This project is a learning project for Optix. 

Based on the [Optix7Course](https://github.com/ingowald/optix7course) source code, the project implements a path tracing renderer and supports more material types. The project utilizes Optix AI Denoiser for denoising and supports rendering of .obj static models. The camera position can be dynamically changed in real-time through input devices. In terms of surface description, the renderer adopts a relatively simple material system, using four parameters: diffuse, metallic, roughness, and emission, to describe the surface properties in a straightforward manner.
